# Triangle
Triangle is a java application where users enter the lengths of  a triangle's 3 sides, and it computes the type of triangle (right, obtuse, or acute), the perimeter, and the area. 

# Requirements
Users need to have java installed on their system. Here is a [link](https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp) to the java downloads page. 

# Installation

## Windows

1. Go to the directory you want the file to be downloaded to, and in the command prompt and enter:
```
wget https://github.com/rrickgauer/Triangle/raw/master/dist/Triangle.jar
```

2. Then, you can either double click on the file through File Explorer, or in the command prompt enter:
```
Triangle.jar
```

## OS X
Coming soon!

# Future plans
- [ ] Graph out a triangle of proportional size after user enters in side lengths.
- [ ] Make gif of application in use.
- [ ] Implement other shapes.
